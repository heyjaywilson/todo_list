# Day 008: Making a TODO list

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/maeganjwilson/todo_list)

**Question**: Where are days 7 and 8?

**Answer**: I didn't do any coding due to the fact that it was the
weekend, and I was busy.

## Things I want to accomplish
## 
- Slide to delete

## Things I accomplished
## 
- Slide to delete

## Things I learned
## 
### The function needed to add "Slide to delete".
### 
The function needed is this one

```swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, commit editingStyle: UITableViewCell.EditingStyle, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        // CODE GOES HERE
    }
```

The way I chose to implement the function is checking if the
`editingStyle` is equal to `.delete` and inside that check, I do the following:

- Delete the todo
- Delete the row from the table view

Here is the final code
```swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, commit editingStyle: UITableViewCell.EditingStyle, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        if editingStyle == .delete {
            todos.deleteTodo(index: indexPath.row)
        }
        tableView.deleteRows(at: [indexPath], with: .left)
    }
```

If you have any questions about what I did or how I implemented anything, let me know! If you have any suggestions or other comments, let me know as well!
