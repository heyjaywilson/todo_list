I switched from "Day ###" to "Post ###" due to the inconsistency of posting. As long as I can keep improving the app, I don't need to worry about how many days. I also didn't have a day goal for the app to be completed by.

This post I am going to focus on some UX decisions that I made early on, and I believe are not very UX friendly.
 
# Things I want to accomplish

- [Dismiss keyboard with "Done" button](https://github.com/maeganjwilson/todo_list/issues/5)
- [Don't add an empty task](https://github.com/maeganjwilson/todo_list/issues/6)

# Things I accomplished

- Dismissing keyboard with "Done button"



# Things I learned
