This whole section could be "How to persist daya on app quit", but I'll go into each part separately.

Core Data is used when data needs to be local.

CloudKit is used when data needs to be synced between devices.

If you have any questions about what I did or how I implemented anything, let me know! If you have any suggestions or other comments, let me know as well!
